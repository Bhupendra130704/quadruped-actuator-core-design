# Design of Actuator Core for Quadruped Limb

This project focuses on the mechanical design of the actuator core and power transmission assembly for a quadruped robot limb.

The primary objective was to enable stable and efficient motion on uneven and rough terrains through an optimized limb-level mechanical design.


## Objective

The main objective of this project was to:

- Enable motion in uneven and rough terrains
- Design a compact actuator core for a quadruped limb
- Develop an efficient power transmission assembly
- Integrate wheel-based mobility within the limb
- Allow switching between wheeled and quadruped locomotion modes


## Problem in Existing Systems

Existing robotic mobility systems face the following challenges:

- Pure wheeled robots struggle on uneven terrain.
- Traditional quadrupeds offer terrain adaptability but sacrifice speed.
- Systems with fixed wheel attachments limit terrain flexibility.
- Many designs lack the ability to switch locomotion mode based on environment.


## Proposed Mechanical Approach

To address these challenges, this design introduces:

- A structurally robust actuator core
- Integrated power transmission mechanism
- Hybrid locomotion capability (Wheel ↔ Leg mode)
- Improved torque delivery for terrain adaptation
- Modular limb design for integration into a quadruped platform

The actuator-transmission assembly enables the limb to adapt mechanically to terrain variations while maintaining structural stability.
